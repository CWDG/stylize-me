# Widgets, Inc.

## About

This exercise is to help you gain familiarity with some common CSS styles, by styling a rather paltry page. Let's say that Widgets, Inc has hired you on to make the following mockup come to life:

## Description

I have included a few files. **Do not modify `index.html` or `css/reset.css`. Only modify `css/main.css`.** The `index.html` file contains all of the content of the site, and needs no modification. The `css/reset.css` file removes all of the default, browser-applied styles from elements (such as `body` padding and `h1` font size). While this may seem like a bad thing, it is usually much easier to write good CSS without the browser-applied styles.

My finished solution (which I will pull-request some time in the near future) was 26 lines including those with only brackets and whitespace. If your solution doesn't fit that fingerprint, that doesn't mean it is wrong! Go ahead an pull-request it, and I'll give you some feedback!

Here are the properties I used:
